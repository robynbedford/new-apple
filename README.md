# New Apple

With a partner, discuss the layout provided below (screenshot are a modified version of the smallest viewport layout on the [Apple Canada Homepage](https://www.apple.com/ca/)) and consider what elements will be required to create the content.

Recreate the layout below using HTML and CSS. **NOTE**: A few of the Apple source images in the folder are slightly different than what's shown below, this is for an upcoming example. Simply create the closest approximation.

For the font, attach and apply `Roboto` ([Google Font can be found here](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto)) in place of Apple's proprietary `SF Pro Display` shown in the screenshots.

# Layout Screenshots

There are _three_ screenshots below, **please review all three before starting.**

The layout with the menu open:

![Apple's Mobile Layout](img/sample-layout-open-menu.png?raw=true "Apple's Mobile Layout")

When the menu is closed, the layout will look like this:

![Apple's Mobile w/ Closed Menu](img/sample-layout.png?raw=true "Apple's Mobile w/ Closed Menu")

This is the menu in isolation (same as in the first image):
